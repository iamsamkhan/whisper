      "transcript": " Hello guys, a very important video for all of you. Please make sure that he was this video till the end. And please to comment down with respect to your learnings right from this video. So, from past three years I have been using this writing pad for teaching students. Now this writing pad was actually given by Sudanshu and it actually, like I was able to write very nicely, see the materials that I have actually created with the help of this writing pad. It is quite amazing, it is from XP pen. Right now this model is not available but you can see that it is completely tearing and wearing off. So, just imagine how much I have written in this writing pad. Now and if I probably show you this writing pen itself, you can see that the tip has also gone completely. Yeah, the tip has definitely gone. Now the thing is that I am also planning, like I have already bought the next writing pad over here. And this is far more better than this one which I actually have. Right and probably in some days just like today I am planning to change this writing pad to this. But the only thing right, I am in love with this writing pad because the kind of notes I was able to prepare was quite amazing. Okay, it was quite beautiful. Right now here is the important learning thing for you. Right now I know this is something based on old technology. Right so if I probably consider one one and a half year, two years back, three years back, we have bought this and now we also have a better version of that. Now even though I know that probably in order to use the new writing pad I need to practice a bit. But I will have a lot of features over there. But the love for the older things I do definitely have. So similarly in our life guys, you know, there will be many people when they are switching to new technology and all right. Initially they will think that it will be quite difficult. But trust me with respect to practice, with respect to the changes that we see in our life. Right see there are many people when there are frequent changes right with respect to technology or anything. They hesitate to do that very quickly. Okay now in my case I'm definitely going to use the new writing pad but I also have the love for this older writing pad. It I know it will probably take some time for getting adjusted for practicing for writing. But at one point of time I love it and I start using it. Okay but still there is that feeling right I'm moving from this to that. I may face some challenges and because of that I'm not moving. I'm taking more time. Right so like this. Everybody will have this kind of situation in your life with respect to learning new things with respect to changing your technology with respect to getting updated with the trends that are happening. You continuously need to work over there right. I know whatever things we used to do before and people who are doing it before right they love it. But this generation demands new things and you have to be updated with respect to that right. So I hope you got the most important learning thing out of this video. This is just a kind of video to make you understand something very important. Okay so yes this was it for my side. I hope you like this particular video. I'll see you all in the next video. Thank you."

      "transcript": " Hello all my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my Udo channel. So guys from past 2 to 3 years I have been uploading a lot of videos that are related to data science, machine learning, deep learning, national language processing. And I have also been teaching in 9 year on, you know where we have taught so many people. And these people are also able to make amazing successful career transition. So in short we are adding a lot of values for making people ready to the data science industry. And this is quite amazing because people are making some amazing successful career transitions and bigger, bigger companies which is the most amazing thing for us. Considering this, you know every year I also make sure that I take a lot of community sessions related to machine learning, deep learning and all. Like in 2021 I had taken, I in 2022 I had actually taken. It's time in 2023 again I start this community series with respect to machine learning, deep learning and national language processing. And this series trust me, the last year series that I have actually taken, you know, it was a 7 days live session, still people watch it, people say a lot of things about it. Right. Now considering this, I thought why not again start a community series in 2023. And this community series will be quite amazing because I am going to create a recorded videos for everyone, you know. And in this recorded videos you will be able to understand about machine learning, national language processing and all. Now who for who can basically learn from this course? See if you are from a basic level, if you don't know anything about data science, I would suggest definitely you can do it. So the level of this community course will be between basic to intermediate, okay, not complex intermediate or advanced, but definitely basic to intermediate so that you can start learning out of it and you can probably gain the knowledge about data science and what all things you can basically do with respect to the data science. We'll be talking about machine learning algorithms, we'll talk about NLP, we'll talk about various techniques in deep learning, you know. And we'll also see basic basic implementation. Actually already I'm creating an end to end project that is complex part, right. But initially your base needs to be very, very strong and that is what is the reason I'm actually starting this series because I've been getting a lot of mail from people, please Chris start a community series this year also where we learn about all this particular basic things and we keep our base completely strong unless and until your base is not strong you will not be able to learn about the advanced thing. So considering this, I'm going to start this particular series. The frequency of the video will be one video in two days or it can also be one video in one day. It is up to you guys, okay. If you make this video like reach up to 1000 or 1000 likes at least, I will try to upload the videos daily, okay. It is up to you again and also make sure that you write down in the comment like what kind of frequency that you want. Two days, one video is sufficient or three days, one video is sufficient or daily one video is sufficient, okay. Again, understand the series is from basic to intermediate. So if you don't know about data science, it will be perfectly good to start with, you'll get the basic idea, you'll get about the algorithms, you'll get to know how to run it in the, how to implement a project, a basic project and then later on, you know, you can also watch my advanced series to become good in it, right. So that is the entire plan, okay. Now considering this, I will also make sure that we'll be providing a free dashboard access from I neuron wherein you will be able to get the materials also with respect to all the handwritten notes that I'm actually trying to give it to you, right. So yes, I hope you are quite excited with this particular series. Again, the main aim of this series is to make sure to make you understand about data science and how things are implemented and again, we'll be learning about machine learning algorithms and all and how the implementation is done and many more things, right. All I want from your side is pure, pure hard work, try to work hard, you know, try to give more and more time to it, you know, only dedication is required from you and the remaining things I will be providing and my team in I neuron will also be helping you out, out with the materials, dashboard access and many more things. Probably from the tomorrow's video that you are going to get, you will be also getting the dashboard access, which I will be also sharing in in tomorrow's videos in the next video that I'm trying to upload, right. So yes, if you like this particular video, share with everyone, call your friends, call share it in your share it with your college friends, share with all the people who want to learn specifically related to data science, machine learning and all. So yes, this was it from my side. I hope you like this particular news. If you like it, please make sure that you subscribe to the channel, hit like and yes, I will see you all in the next video. Thank you. Take care."

      "transcript": " Hello all my name is Krishna and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys it's been more than six plus years I have been teaching data science and data analytics. I've taught a lot of people people from domains or different background and I've seen people making successful career transition into the data and tech industry even from tech and non tech background also and you know if you probably follow me in LinkedIn every week at least two to three transition stories I upload and yes I do get a lot of messages with respect to the transition but here what I really want to convey is that why all these people were able to make the career transition. See there are also many students who have still not been able to make that career transition what they specifically require and if I say if I talk about those people also have made successful career transition it is mostly 80 percentage of those things is mostly because of the efforts that they have actually put. Yes 20% of what is guidance that is specifically required with respect to teaching what is required in the data science industry I was able to help them out right but the remaining 80% was all because of those people who have made successful career transition because they were dedicated they practice daily they made sure that they made additional projects they keep on revising things they keep on looking new tools they made sure that they were updated with respect to the industry that is basically happening right now. Gen.D.V.I is becoming very very popular and I have seen many people who have already made transition they are working in the Gen.D.V.I field so what in short I really want to say is that unless and until you don't put that specific effort and when I talk about that particular effort it should be a consistent effort it is not like one or a couple of days you know and this I can see you know there are also many people you know who had started let's say they have started 3 years back you know there were much students they started 3 years back preparing for their data analytics industry then in between because of some of the other reason they left it and again now in this year last year many people again started pinging me saying that Krish hei I really want to start again right so what would be the best possible way for me to start right so what is actually happening and I have also seen some people you know in the first week of let's say that I want to make a transition to the data analytics industry here first week I am devoting 5 to 6 7 hours you know daily I am learning things but coming from the next week itself the number of hours also gets reduced with respect to the preparation now what is the main thing over here guys why this consistency is dropping you know if you are looking and I am not just talking with respect to data analytics industry and talking irrespective of any technology that you are specifically preparing for you know unless and until you don't be consistent trust me it will be very difficult to crack something you know yes if you are that lucky guy you know without working hard you will be able to crack yes I have also seen those kind of people but trust me in my case unless and until I don't work hard okay I don't work hard I am not going to get that fruit I don't I don't even get any success over there right right now today also I keep on investing my time to see what new things are there in the market what new things we can basically implement in the data science and based on that I regularly upload my videos today itself I uploaded a video of Lang serve in Langshin how you can create efficiently an API for an LLM app so this is what I am specifically doing right why because I really want to stay updated in the market and what kind of work that I do you know making sure that you get updated with respect to all the data science thing and yes later in the chance later in the future if I get any chance to implement something I will definitely implement those kind of thing right so one important thing from your side that you should really do never quit something yes if you are planning that okay I really don't want to go into the career probably the step that I have actually taken is a kind of mistake if you say like that then you can definitely quit it but if you say that hey no I am going to stop for some days in between and again start preparing don't do that okay it is not a good idea after devoting some amount of time and then quitting okay and please make sure that you have that thing in your mind that yes anything if you work hard for that you will be able to get it you know data science is hard I believe data analytics is hard not in a couple of days you will be able to understand that but once you start giving some kind of consistent efforts trust me it will work it will definitely become your friend you'll understand everything that is going around you because of data science I was just able to understand many things outside outside just data science itself I was able to understand real world problem statement I was able to understand how mathematical equation is related to a real world problem statement right I could actually visualize it I could actually see it I could actually relate it and because of that trust me I took this specific field right so this is what you also need to find out I'm not just saying with respect to data science I'm talking irrespective of any technology that you're working why you really want to go into that understand the interest where it probably where do you see yourself in the next upcoming five years and then probably take the decision right one very good term you know that I would definitely like to say to use that you really need to be a see any startups right when they create the product how a startup become successful because their product finds the perfect market fit similarly you are also a product okay and when I say you are a product right I basically mean that you also need to find your market fit right so keep on working hard guys and I would suggest never quit never give up keep on working that is what human beings are for as a space is going to become more competitive become smarter in a way that how you can utilize AI in your fundamental problem statement and definitely do amazing things in your life so yes this was it from I said I'll see you all in the next video have a great day thank you one doll take care bye bye"
