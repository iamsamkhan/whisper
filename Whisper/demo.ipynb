      "Transcription: hello all my name is krish Naik and welcome to my YouTube channel so guys yes this particular video is again related to some advice and guidance that I really want to provide you all and yes in this video I am going to talk about AI I want to go to provide you some kind of advice at least to start learning AI and there is a reason why I am specifically saying you this I am not saying that ok and goal should be probably making a transition working in some AI companies analytics industry not as such but start incorporating AI in your day to day life evolving a lot of new things are probably coming up initially we had machine learning deep learning not generally models and probably in the upcoming two years definitely a lot of companies are come going to come up with different different Startup ideas just using this kind of LLB models where they are specifically solving some kind of problem ok but my advice will be that you know start learning AI to incorporate the capabilities that you can actually put in your day to day activities you know as you know data data Speaks a lot you know and if you probably know AI machine learning deep learning trust me you will be able to explore many more information from that specific data and not saying that ok learn just to get a job but instead learn to make yourself more productive and you can definitely do that I know many people are working in different domains different technologies in different programming language they have been a different work but at least have an idea about AI start incorporating that in your life you may be thinking Crush you are a youtuber you are doing it for your purpose you know you may gain subscribers you may probably bring up your telling people to buy courses I am not saying nothing as such I am saying that wherever you get some sources learning at not my channel at least from somewhere else is so many open source documentation that are available you know once you start incorporating it trust me opportunities are them anymore in the world not only see if you don't want to work anyway at least use it in your personal life right you have your financial data right you have your let's say I'll give you one example one of my friend is call me this morning right he was saying the crush I am running a business you know I have this specific use cases and this is only possible because of machine learning can you help me out in this you know that I also want to learn this now let it be a business create you are a person who is running a business you are a person who is working on some of the other thing and there if you get a bit of chances of automatic things trust me I will come into picture ok and this is super important this is the advice that I really want to give to everyone ok my main aim is to democracy this AI education to everyone that is the reason why I have come up with this YouTube channel when I specifically upload videos related to everything that is in Ai tomorrow anything that probably comes I will be explaining you I will be teaching you I will be showing you multiple examples you know yeah it is up to you whether you want to make it as a full-time opportunity whether you want to learn it in such a way that you may probably get a job but start incorporating it is up to you guys I am not forcing you but starting it try to use it in your day to day practices you will be able to see the changes have seen some of my friends getting productive you know I have my cousin brother who is working in US and from past two years you know he is working his architect working with something else some other Technology some other domain but still he has started using AI in his day to day activities and this is the most important advice that I really want to give it to you right again my to democracy education to everyone that is the reason I am uploading this many number of videos with respect to learning anything it is up to you find out any sources but start learning this is the advice that I really want to give it to you because you will be seeing how much changes it is going to come up in the upcoming 2 years right now lines in is going on you can actually create your own LLM models you know I was just solving a use case right now what are documents I have let's say I want to I want to probably create an LLM model with respect to my data and I was seeing that I had a 2GB of files that is present PDF files which are a lot of content I was able to train my own chat box so this kind of examples will definitely come up I'll show you how you can probably train it right but I want to do it for my day today let's say that I have my Excel sheet of all the expenditures all the expenses that I am doing right in some format right I can also train that specific thing Malayalam models can I give an advice where I can probably save some money right this is just one some of the examples that I really want to come up with in front of you right lot of applications will be there and definitely do make sure that you take up this advice take it seriously not for making not for working full time at least but at least try to incorporate this knowledge in your life so yes I hope you like this particular video if you like this I'll see all in the next video I have a great day thank you wonder take care\n"

      "Chunk 2: companies analytics industry not as such but start incorporating AI in your day to day lives ai's evolving a lot lot of new things are probably coming up initially we had machine learning deep learning models and probably in the upcoming two years definitely lot of companies are come going to come up with different different Startup ideas just using this kind of LLM models where they are specifically solving some kind of problem ok\n",
      "Chunk 3: but my advice will be that you know start learning AI to incorporate the capabilities that you can actually put in your day-to-day activities you know as you know data data Speaks a lot you know and if you probably know AI machine learning deep learning trust me you will be able to explore many more information from that specific data and not saying that ok learn just to get a job but instead learn to make\n",
      "Chunk 4: more productive and you can definitely do that I know many people are working in different domains different Technologies and different programming language they having a different work but at least have an idea about AI start incorporating that in your life you may be thinking Crush you are a youtuber you are doing it for your purpose you know you may gain subscribers you may probably bring up your telling people to buy courses I am not saying nothing as such I am saying that wherever you get some sources\n",
      "Chunk 5: learning at not my channel at least from somewhere else is so many open source documentation that are available you know once you start incorporating it trust me opportunities are there many more in the world not only see if you don't want to work anyway at least use it in your personal life right you have your financial data right you have your let's say I'll give you one example one of my friend is called me this morning right he was saying the question I am running a business you know I have this specific use cases and this is\n",
      "Chunk 6: possible because of machine learning can you help me out in this you know and he is saying his purposely saying that I also want to learn the snap you know let it be a business create you are a person who is running a business you are a person who who is working on some of the other thing and there if you get a bit of chances of automatic things trust me AI will come into picture ok and this is super important this is the advice that I really want to give to everyone ok again\n",
      "Chunk 7: my name is to democracy education to everyone that is the reason why I have come up with this YouTube channel when I specifically upload videos related to everything that is in Ai tomorrow anything that probably comes I will be explaining you I will be teaching you I will be showing you multiple examples you know yeah it is up to you whether you want to make it as a full-time opportunity whether you want to learn it in such a way that you may probably get a job but start incorporating it is up to you guys I am not forcing you but start\n",
      "Chunk 8: getting it try to use it in your day to day practices you will be able to see the changes at seen some of my friends getting productive you know I have my cousin brother who is working in US and from past two years you know he is working in his architect working with something else some other Technology some other domain but still he has started using AI in his day to day activities and this is the most important advice that I really want to give it to you right again my\n",
      "Chunk 9: to democracy education to everyone that is the reason I am uploading this many number of videos with respect to learning anything it is up to you find out any sources but start learning this is the advice that I really want to give it to you because you will be seeing how much changes it is going to come up in the upcoming 2 years right now lines in is going on you can actually create your own LLM models you know I was just solving a use case right now whatever documents I have let's say\n",
      "Chunk 10: I want to I want to probably create an LLM model with respect to my data and I was just seeing that I had a 2GB of files that is present PDF files which are a lot of content I was able to train my own chat box so this kind of examples will definitely come up I will show you how you can probably train it right but I want to do it for my day to day purpose see let's say that I have my Excel sheets of all the expenditures all the expenses that I am doing right in some format right I can also train that specific thing\n"

all and yes in this video I am going to talk about AI I want to go to provide you some kind of advice at least to start learning AI and there is a reason why I am specifically saying you this I am not saying that ok and goal should be probably making a transition working in some AI companies analytics industry not as such but start incorporating AI in your day to day life evolving a lot of new things are probably coming up initially we had machine learning deep learning models and probably in the upcoming two years definitely a lot of companies are coming to come up with different different Startup ideas just using this kind of LLB models where they are specifically solving some kind of problem ok but my advice will be that you know start learning AI to incorporate the capabilities that you can actually put in your day-to-day activities you know as you know data data Speaks a lot you know and if you probably know AI machine learning deep learning trust me you will be able to explore many more information from that specific data and not saying that ok learn just to get a job but instead learn to make yourself more productive and you can definitely do that I know many people are working in different domains different technologies in different programming language they have been a different work but at least have an idea about AI start incorporating that in your life you may be thinking Crush you are a youtuber you are doing it for your purpose you know you may gain subscribers you may probably bring up your telling people to buy courses I am not saying nothing as such I am saying that wherever you get some sources learning at not my channel at least from somewhere else is so many open source documentation that are available you know once you start incorporating it trust me opportunities are there many more in the world not only see if you don't want to work anyway at least use it in your personal life right you have your financial data right you have your let's say I'll give you one example one of my friend is call me this morning right he was saying the Krishna I am running a business you know I have this specific use cases and this is only possible because of machine learning can you help me out in this you know that I also want to learn this now let it be a business create you are a person who is running a business you are a person who is working on some of the other thing and there if you get a bit of chances of automatic things trust me I will come into picture ok and this is super important this is the advice that I really want to give to everyone ok my name is to democracy this AI education to everyone that is the reason why I have come up with this YouTube channel very specifically upload videos related to everything that is in Ai tomorrow anything that probably comes I will be explaining you I will be teaching you I will be showing you multiple examples you know yeah it is up to you whether you want to make it as a full-time opportunity weather you want to learn it in such a way that you may probably get a job but start incorporating it is up to you guys I am not forcing you but starting it try to use it in your day to day practices you will be able to see the changes have seen some of my friends getting productive you know I have my cousin brother who is working in US and from past two years you know his working his architect working with something else some other Technology some other domain but still he has started using AI in his day to day activities and this is the most important advice that I really want to give it to you again my to democracy education to everyone that is the reason I am uploading this many number of videos with respect to learning anything it is up to you find out any sources but start learning this is the advice that I really want to give it to you because you will be seeing how much changes it is going to come up in the upcoming 2 years right now lines in is going on you can actually create your own LLM models you know I was just solving a use case right now whatever documents I have let's say I want to I want to problem create an LLM model with respect to my data and I was seeing that I had a 2GB of files that is present PDF files which are a lot of content I was able to train my own chat box so this kind of examples will definitely come up and I'll show you how you can probably train it right but I want to do it for my day today let's say that I have my Excel sheet of all the expenditures all the expenses that I am doing right in some format right I can also train that specific thing Malayalam models can I give an advice where I can probably save some money right this is just one some of the examples that I really want to come up with in front of you right lot of applications will be there and definitely do make sure that you take up this advice take it seriously not for making not for working full time at least but at least try to incorporate this knowledge in your life so yes I hope you like this particular video if you like this I have a great day and thank you wonder bye bye take care\n"

      " Hello all, my name is Krashanayak and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, yes, this particular video is again related to some advice, some guidance that I really want to provide you all. And yes, in this video, I'm going to talk about AI. I want to go to provide you some kind of advice at least to start learning AI. And there is a reason why I am specifically saying you this. I'm not saying that, okay that your end goal should be probably making a transition, working in some AI companies, analytics industry, not as such, but start incorporating AI in your day to day lives. AI is evolving a lot, a lot of new things are probably coming up. Initially, we had machine learning, deep learning, now, generally AI, L LLM models and probably in the upcoming two years definitely a lot of companies are going to come up with different different startup ideas just using this kind of LLM models where they are specifically solving some kind of problem. But my advice will be that start learning AI to incorporate the capabilities that you can actually put in your day to day activities, you know, as you know, data, data speaks a lot, you know, and if you probably know AI, machine learning, deep learning, trust me you will be able to explore many more information from that specific data. I'm not saying that okay learn just to get a job but instead learn to make yourself more productive and you can definitely do that. I know many people are working in different domains, different technologies and different programming languages, they are having a different work but at least have an idea about AI, start incorporating that in your life. You may be thinking, Chris, you are a YouTuber, you're doing it for your purpose. You know, you may gain subscribers, you may probably bring up, you're telling people to buy courses. I'm not saying nothing as such. I'm saying that wherever you get some sources, start learning it, not my channel, at least from somewhere else. There's so many open source documentation that are available. You know, once you start incorporating it, trust me, opportunities are there many more in the world, not only see if you don't want to work anywhere, at least use it in your personal life. Right? You have your financial data, right? You have your, let's say, I'll give you one example. One of my friends just called me this morning, right? He was saying that I'm running a business, you know, I have this specific use cases and this is only possible because of machine learning. Can you help me out in this? You know, and he's saying, he's purposely saying that I also want to learn this now. Let it be a business creator, you are a person who is running a business, you are a person who is working on some or the other thing. And there if you get a bit of chances of automating things, trust me, AI will come into picture. Okay. And this is super important democratize this AI education to everyone. That is the reason I have come up with this YouTube channel where I specifically upload videos related to everything that is in AI. Tomorrow anything that probably comes, I will be explaining you. I will be teaching you. I will be showing you multiple examples. It is up to you whether you want to make it as a full time opportunity, whether you want to learn it in such a way that you may probably get a job but start incorporating it. It is up to you guys. I'm not forcing you but start incorporating it. Try to use it in your day to day practices. You will be able to see the changes. I've seen some of my friends getting productive. You know, I have my cousin brother who is working in US and from past two years, you know, he's working in some, he's a architect working in something else, some other technology, some other domain, but still he has started using AI in his day to day activities and you can see that productivity. And this is the most important advice that I really want to give it to you. Again, my main aim is to democratize AI education to everyone. That is the reason why I'm uploading this many number of videos with respect to learning anything. It is up to you. Find out any sources but start learning. This is the advice I want to give to you. Because you will be seeing how much changes it is going to come up in the upcoming two years. Right now, Lanchin is going on. You can actually create your own LLM models. I was just solving a use case right now. Whatever documents I have, let's say I want to probably create an LLM model with respect to my data. I was just seeing that I had a 2GB of files that is present, PDF files which had a lot of content, I was able to train my own chatbot. So this kind of examples will definitely come up. I'll show you how you can probably train it. Right. But I want to do it for my day to day purpose. and my LLM models can give advice where I can probably save some money. This is just one of the examples that I really want to come up with in front of you. A lot of applications will be there and definitely do make sure that you take up this advice, take it seriously, not for making, not for working full time at least, but at least try to incorporate this knowledge in your life. So yes, I hope you like this particular video. If you like this, I'll see you all in the next video. Have a great day. Thank you, Wanda. Bye-bye, take care.\n"

      " Portado was my classmate. He was reasonably bright. Never came to college. He used to stay from Goa. He was in the hostel and to come to college. Our college was 7 to 11, he will come around 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock, earliest mean 9 o'clock. And he will sit here, sit there, attend two classes. After that, that afternoon he will come for the lab etc. end of the year he will one month he will get up early and he will study and you know there is a method in college. You take question papers, April and October. Whatever comes in October will never come in April. I am sure in the school also you have. Midterm will never come to final. So eliminate these question answers and then make an approximate question paper and study that and he used to get a first class. He did all four years like this. Once I asked Portado, Portado why you are such a bright person, you don't come to class. If you come regularly, he can get distinction. You can get a rank. He said, Suda, you do not know. In life, it is not the education. It is the connection that really works. And we have to build a lot of connections. You know, when you are young, it helps you. I came from a middle-class family my father was a doctor a gynecologist I never understood this connection all those things then I said my father was in military were in Calcutta, there was a club which we have never seen in our real life. So we thought maybe the big man and it is no beyond our, our bus is not nahi I felt it said something years past in 1972 I finished my engineering so was Portado and I didn't meet him for long time after 30 30-35 years, I think 2008 or 2009, I had been to Dubai to deliver a lecture and when the lecture was over, I saw somebody waiting for me and then he said, ma'am, I was waiting for you. I was surprised. The place like Dubai. Who will wait for me? Then he said, I am Portado. I could not recognize because in 30, 40 years people put on weight, your hair will be grey. You know all those physical changes will happen. I said, Portado, I would not recognize. I was very happy. I told him, oh let us sit down and talk. He said, no, I just wanted to tell you one word. One word to you, so I was waiting. I said, what happened? He said, do you remember in college I used to bunk class I said of course I remember you ported out means bunking class he said I used to bunk class and I joined a job and the because in those days moment you have BE used to get job in my time. And my bosses came to know that, my subordinates came to know that I don't have knowledge. Getting a first class marks different than knowledge. Please remember, parents, your children should be in the pursuit of knowledge than the marks. Though it is a competitive examination. I agree. It is a competitive world. It is a competitive examination. I agree it is a competitive world. It is a competitive world. Competition is thousand times or ten thousand times more than what time I had. But with all those things, the knowledge which always helps you than your marks in real life. So he said, I got marks but I did not have knowledge. Once the subordinates know that you don't have knowledge, they don't respect you. Once the boss knows you don't have knowledge, then he wants a reason to kick you out. I was kicked out from one job, then I took a second job and I was so was so much used to getting up 9 in the morning I will go late to the office I was kicked out there also over a period of time I could not get job anyway and now I have a job as a manager job or a smaller job in Dubai. And I said, what about your family? I said, I have two daughters. I left them in Chennai to study. I said what? He said yes, I want they should study well, they should not become like me. I just waited for you to tell Suda one thing, when we were young I used to to make fun of you. He used to tell me, you are like a running race horse because the horse will see neither left nor right, it runs.. Same way you always were academic and used to make fun of you. Today when we called you nerd and I thought I was very smart know, today I feel you are successful and I wasted my life. I just wanted to tell you, if you don't discipline, if you don't discipline when you are in school or college, you pay a heavy price in later part of your life. Discipline, like coming up in a proper way, writing properly, talking properly, communicating properly, अगर बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा और बादा � Respecting people properly, this really helps a long way in your life. So I don't want you to be like a potato regretting your old age. You should remember that to be successful in life there is no shortcut. The only method is hard work and straight way and that you have to do. And remember one more part that your school you come as a raw product to school like a raw material to school school turns you out 14 years and takes you out as a finished good you come out as a young toddler here you and you go out a fine teenager. The school has done so much not for the fees what you give. Your fees are minimal when you compare to the kind of advantage you get in real life. Your teachers, your parents, everyone put so much hard work to make you a young teenager. Please remember the school is your alma mater. And when you grow big, when you make money more than what you need, you should always help your alma mater because that is the place which has given you a life in real life.\n"

      " Hello, my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, I hope for the past couple of days you have seen a lot of videos related to Devon, the first AI software engineer. Probably every YouTuber has uploaded this specific video and obviously they have brought a lot of points with respect comparing to a software engineer jobs. But let's understand in this video what all things Devan can actually do and as you all know many people have applied for the beta version of Devan and they have got the access and with respect to that they have created a lot of videos. So we'll just try to get a clear idea like what all efficient task it can actually do. And after understanding all these things, we will be discussing about the pros and cons. And as a software engineer, what you really need to focus to be in the industry with a good demand what all things you can actually do we'll also be discussing about that. So please make sure that it was this video till the end because there will be a lot of things to discuss in this. Okay, so here was the video of the Devin first AI software engineer. We just saw the demo. But just to understand, you can see what is exactly Devon. It is the world's first autonomous AI software engineer. Devon is tireless, skilled, he met equally ready to build alongside you or independently complete task for you to review. So in short, since it is an AI, so it really need to work tirelessly, right? With human beings, it is not possible, right? Now, a very important is over here. With Devan engineers can focus more on the interesting problem statement and engineer teams can strive for more ambitious goals because all the previous problem statements are already solved by the engineers and with respect to that they already have the data code, whatever things are specifically required. So obviously you really need to have a news problem statement to think upon which Devan cannot solve. Whatever things are actually solved, Devan will be able to solve it because they are already trained on that. So this is the most major point. Still, any new thing, any new problem statement that may come, Devin will not be able to solve it because it needs to get trained. It's just like like an AI if it if there is a solution then it will be trained then it will be able to do it okay. Unless and until AGI does not come I don't think so it will be able to do it. Now let's understand about Devin's capability. Okay. Here you'll be able to see we have given Devin the ability to actively collaborate with the user. Devin reports on its progress in real time, accepts feedback and works together with you through design choices as needed. Obviously, as a software engineer, whatever task is required for a software engineer, it is able to do they're working in a collaborative way. They have to make sure that they have all the documentation, sprints, stories needs to be assigned very much in an equal way to all the developers itself. You actually do with respect to the implementation that they have done. So here you can see Devin can learn how to use unfamiliar technologies also. Right. So after reading a blog post, Devin runs control not on model to produce images which conceals messages for Sara. So one of the users they were able to do from this particular blog. Devin can build end and deploy apps end to end. So this was actually possible by Devin. They were able to build and deploy it because already, you know, how to build it and all and how to deploy it, that is the tie end of task. And obviously from the demo that we have seen a couple days back, it has those kind of functionalities. Along with this, whenever we see the next task over here, you can see that Devin can also autonomously find and fix bugs in the code basis. That basically means Devan helps Andrew maintain and debug its open source competitive programming book. So obviously when you have this entire code base, you know, and it is being able to solve it. Okay. And we'll also be seeing there is a something called as a SWE benchmark. Okay. We'll discuss about it. Like in the GitHub open, open issues, like how much it was able to solve, you know. So here, the next task here, you can see Devon can train and fine tune its own AI models. Devon can address bugs and feature requests in open source repositories. Just give the GitHub issues and do the setup and context gathering that is only needed and Devon will be able to do it. Devin can contribute to mature production repositories, which is also very, really good. We even tried giving Devin real jobs on Upwork and it could do those two, right? So if you don't know about Upwork, it is all about freelancing. Now just imagine you don't even have to stay there to do any freelancing work. It can probably consider it. it can probably solve it. And with respect to all this work that you can actually see, all the demo video is actually given and how it was able to do it. Now just by seeing this obviously we can actually see that Devin can really do a lot many things right and if I probably consider a normal software engineer right now what is actually expected in interviews in the future in upcoming one to two years, there will be a lot of expectation. You really need to be a jack of all trades, you know, you should have knowledge with respect to everything. But yes, if there is a problem statement that requires actual research out of box thinking out of box thinking to solve it, then human beings are the best people to solve it. Later on, whatever task are there, whatever repetitive task are there, whatever things that are already implemented, Devin can actually do it for you. Now, this was one of the things, which I was talking about SWE bench. So in the GitHub repository, whatever are the open issues, right? You can probably see World GitHub issues, how much it was able to solve it. So here you can see we evaluated Devin on HWE Bench, a challenging benchmark that asked agent to resolve real world GitHub issues found in open source projects like Django and Skykitla. Devin correctly resolves 13.86%. All the issues end to end, which is quite good. And the previous state of art was 1.96. Now, with respect to all the other tools, like Cloudy 2, SW, Lama 13, BSHW, Lama 7, BGPT, 4GPT 3.5, here you can actually see, you know, the difference is quite huge and Devin is really, really having a good number over here. That is 13.86. Now, you know, this, this really looks, yes, Devin can do a lot many tasks. But as I said, when it comes to problem statement that comes out of the box to solve it, definitely Devan cannot do because they are not trained in those kind of data. But as a software engineer, one thing that you really need to do is that companies will also look at, you know, whether it's their simpler tasks, whether they are common implemented tasks to quickly do it. And when there is some very hard task complex tasks, obviously human will be required. So please make sure that you have skill sets, technologies with respect to the complete 360 degree. So I hope you like this particular video. This was it for my side. I'll see you on the next video. Have a great day. Thank you, Wandaul. Take care. Bye-bye.\n"
